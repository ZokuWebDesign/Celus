# Celus: Smart Thyroid Nodule Assessment ⚕️

Welcome to **Celus**, a clinical-grade application designed to assist healthcare professionals in the structured evaluation of thyroid nodules using the ACR TI-RADS protocol. With a user-centered interface and medically accurate logic, Celus supports ultrasound interpretation with clarity, speed, and precision. 

You can access the [project's live website here](https://salus-celus.com.br/).

> Celus streamlines the classification of thyroid nodules by guiding the user through each ACR TI-RADS criterion — composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, and echogenic foci — and instantly calculates the final risk score and recommendations.

### Key sections include:

- 🧱 **Composition Selector** – Choose between cystic, solid, spongiform or mixed nodules, following ACR definitions.
- 🌈 **Echogenicity Evaluation** – Compare nodule brightness to surrounding tissue for accurate scoring.
- 🔷 **Shape Analysis** – Identify if the nodule is “wider-than-tall” or “taller-than-wide” for proper risk stratification.
- 📏 **Margin Definition** – Describe the borders as smooth, irregular, or with extrathyroidal extension.
- ✨ **Echogenic Foci Input** – Indicate presence of microcalcifications, macrocalcifications or comet-tail artifacts.
- 🧮 **Scoring Engine** – Automatic point attribution and final TI-RADS classification, with guidance on follow-up or biopsy.
